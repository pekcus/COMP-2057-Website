		<h1>Sources</h1>
		<p>
			To give my website a super cute theme, I did my best to take images directly from their sources, but this wasn't always possible. 
			Many of the images I used (specifically for decoration) were reposted to tumblr from unknown sources. While that is typically harmful, 
			the graphics I used are pixel art from the "old web" which were created and shared in the early 2000's. These graphics were especially 
			popular in Japan with its large "kawaii" subculture. As the internet evolved, many of the websites and blogs that these graphics were 
			originally posted on have been shut down or deleted. Since I don't know Japanese, and many of the original sources are gone, there is no 
			way for me to confidently track down the artists.
		</p>
		<p>
			<i>However</i>, there is a positive aspect to the situation: the internet users who originally saved those pixel images aided in 
			preserving many of these graphics that would otherwise have been deleted along with their original websites! In addition, many tumblr 
			pixel bloggers have links on their pages to their favourite websites for finding pixel art; many of these websites are run by the
			pixel artists themselves!
