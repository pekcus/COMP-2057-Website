		<h1>Welcome!</h1>

			Hiya, my name is Nonika, and this website is all about me! The only problem is that I love way too many things to 
			explore here. How? Well, I love learning and trying new things, and all of those interests and experiences can add 
			up very quickly! To make this website a bit more manageable, I focused on the most basic things: school, hobbies, 
			and one of my interests! I made a page for each of them, so when you’re ready, click any of the links in my 
			navigation bar to the left!

		<h2>My Web-spiration</h2>
		<p style="text-align:center;">
			Did you know that this is my very first website? I’ve been using the internet since I was a kid, and I’ve always been 
			impressed by the really cool websites and games that others would make. I wanted to learn how to make websites and games 
			for a while now, and I never really got around to it… until now, that is. I took this Intro to the Internet class as a 
			push to get myself started, and I’ve been really enjoying researching and implementing all the features to make my website 
			unique! Hopefully I’ll keep learning more about website and browser game development—I think it would be really cool to 
			make my own game someday!

		<p style="text-align:center;">
			Maybe I'll start by making a picrew...

		<p style="font-size:16px; text-align:right;">
			You may be wondering: “what’s up with this childish theme?” While the clean minimalist design is popular for the largest 
			websites today (like search engines and social media sites), to be honest, I think it’s pretty boring… Personally, I prefer 
			to incorporate fun colours and images; whether online or in real life, visual excitement can add a much needed pop of fun to 
			a space! It was the old websites for kids that first inspired me as a child, which is why I wanted that style to be my main 
			inspiration for my first complete website! The most recognizable attributes of those websites were the pixel art images, the 
			patterned backgrounds, and the use of decorative images. I incorporated all three of those to give my website a clean yet 
			retro look, which I tied together with a cute purple theme! Feel free to take a look around, I hope you like it!!!
